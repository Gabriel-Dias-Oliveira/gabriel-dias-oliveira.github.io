## ATTENTION

* The main objective of the project was to work with CSS and accountability. Issues such as system colors were not rigorously thought through.
* The site - currently - is strictly static, the JS application is a continuation of the project. :)
* It was a fun and fruitful experience, in addition to being fundamental for the continuity of my studies in the WEB area.
* Feel free to use the code and change it as you wish.
